Purposfully taking the different side just to see if there might be any benefits to be found. I have a very analytic approuch this this. Taking a step back every once in a while to realize we're not going where we want to be going.\n\nI'm very pasionate about the projects I work on and want projects to succeed. This doesn't necessarily mean the product I wanted at the start but the thing I'm happy and proud about releasing to the public. Along the way there will be a lot of lessons to be learned, this is how I keep growing as a person and a coder.\n",
