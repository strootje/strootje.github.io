<!-- Short intro -->
Fitness has always interested me. I've been doing it on and off for about 2 years now but wasn't getting the results I wanted.
So I've decided to hire a Personal Trainer (PT).

	Ik wil dat mijn klanten door middel van sport zowel fysiek als mentaal sterker worden. Mijn motto is: "Do something today that your future self will thank you for..."

<!-- The intake -->
The intake was quite unusual. First of all, he approached me in my gym. Apparently I wasn't squatting properly. We had a big discussion about what is and isn't the proper way to squat and he even showed and helped me with my squat. Bear in mind that he approached me and I hadn't payed a dime yet.
After that he told me we could do a free introduction session, where he'd go along with me to see if I could improve in other area's as well.
