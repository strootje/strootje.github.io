Hi, my name is *Bastiaan Stroosnijder*, but good luck pronouncing that. My friends just call me *Bas*. I'm a 29 year old web/software engineer currently living in the Ntherlands. In July of 2017 they found a critical bug in genetic code which made my heartmuscle grow a lot larger that normal. As there is no fix yet, the surgeon proposed a workaround that consisted of adding an `display: none;` to the `.septim {}` class of my heart.

<!-- I am still figuring out what my business is, but currently ... -->
Currently I'm the Lead Developer of one of the teams at *PGGM* where, together with about ten other teams, we are working hard at rebuilding and improving an old monolithic in-house piece of software. I derive satisfaction from setting up automatic process which help us improve the quality of our part of software and sharing that knowledge in-house. At PGGM we build mainly proprietary software, but I have a certain love for everything open source. You can always find me working on something over at my [Github Account][github].

<!-- intention with this blog -->
My current project is the this blog and this [theme][github:scarecrow]. With this blog I want to try and reach out to anyone interested, which would be mostly developers I'm guessing, by expressing my creative side. I want to share the high's and low's of my life and be able to write about it. I want to better the world by writing more open source code that anyone can use to improve their projects. And I want to ......

<!-- my hobbies: hiking, backpacking, sports, volunteering -->
I'll probably also write about some of my hobbies. these mainly consist of hiking, sports, backpacking, cooking and volunteering.

<!-- anything else? -->







I hope you enjoy reading my stuff as much as I struggle with writing it.
That way, we both improve a little bit every day

<!-- old text:
I'm the kind of guy that is unable to do nothing. I'll always busy myself with something. One day I'll have this project in my head and won't stop talking about it and the next day I'll be nowhere to be found since I'm in the middle of nowhere, hiking or biking.

Everything I do is under extreme criticism, this is both my biggest advantage and my greatest downfall. This takes shape in a lot of trail and error. My point of reflection is very early in the process because of this. I love change. Trying a different approuch then the rest. But I an very weary of change because of change.
