Hi, my name is Bastiaan Stroosnijder, but good luck pronouncing that. My friends just call me Bas. I'm a 29 year old web/software engineer currently living in the Ntherlands. In July of 2017 they found a critical bug in genetic code which made my heartmuscle grow a lot larger that normal. As there is no fix yet, the surgeon proposed a workaround that consisted of adding an `display: none;` to the `.septim {}` class of my heart.

<!-- I am still figuring out what my business is, but currently ... -->
Currently I'm the Lead Developer of one of the teams at PGGM where, together with about ten other teams, we are working hard at rebuilding and improving an old monolithic in-house piece of software. I drive satisfaction from setting up automatic process which help us improve the quality of our part of software and sharing that knowledge in-house. At PGGM we build mainly proprietary, but I have a certain love for open source software. You can always find me working on something over at my [Github Account][github].

I hope you enjoy reading my stuff as much as I struggle with writing it.
