Hi, as can be read in [this][post:an-introductory-of-myself] post, I'm Bas. A Software engineer with a clear vision on software and how a team should operate. My friends would tell you that I'm very much focused on furthering my personal development and that I'm a life hacker. I believe this is backed up by my sense of curiosity and drive to explore and engage in new activities wherever I can in life. I love sharing my findings with others and helping them improve as well, nothings beats seeing that *click* in someones eyes just as they get something right.
