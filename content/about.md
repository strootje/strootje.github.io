All my friends just call me *Bas*, which if you're an English speakers still sounds like 'berry' in Dutch.

Combined with my last name, which literarly translates to 'straw cutter', I become the strawberry coder.
luckely my development skill are a lot better than my jokes...

I'm the kind of guy that is unable to do nothing. I'll always busy myself with something. One day I'll have this project in my head and won't stop talking about it and the next day I'll be nowhere to be found since I'm in the middle of nowhere, hiking or biking.

Everything I do is under extreme criticism, this is both my biggest advantage and my greatest downfall. This takes shape in a lot of trail and error. My point of reflection is very early in the process because of this. I love change. Trying a different approuch then the rest. But I an very weary of change because of change.
